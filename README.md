# HumzLanguage
So this is a language that compiles down to Brainfuck (with a few modifications). Its very much a work in progress, and isn't well commented yet.
I will write docs at some point, but until then this is mainly for me to keep a track of changes/issues.
The code is very unoptimized and not pythonic - I was mainly trying to get it working - I'll make it look pretty some other time.
